1. When running the insights module pipeline, it was getting timed out as it is always in queued status and never getting processed.Â 
We had to use the spark pool for each of the notebooks to make the pipeline successful. It would be great if this is mentioned somewhere in the documentation.
2. Microsoft Education Insights Module Version 0.2 has been removed from the github repository with out any notice, as a result we had to use version 0.1.
